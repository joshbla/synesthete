  # Phase 4 temporal knobs

  seq_len: 8
  # - prev_latent_weight: strength of previous-frame latent conditioning (0 disables temporal coupling).

  # Phase 4 training robustness knobs (reduce train/infer mismatch)
  # - p_prev_latent_drop: randomly drop prev_latent conditioning (can reduce over-smoothing).

  # - p_prev_latent_noisy: replace prev_latent with one noised to the current timestep t (improves robustness).

  # Default smoke behavior: sample a random style (matches "real" generation).
  # If you suspect style is masking audio-reactivity, temporarily set:
  #   style_mode: "zero"
  style_mode: "random"
  # For easier A/B comparisons, you can set a fixed seed here.
  # Leave null for maximum variety.
  style_seed: 123

# Phase 3 smoke knobs: keep variety high but not too chaotic.
# If outputs look "static-y blobs", reduce aug/composite first before changing primitives.
